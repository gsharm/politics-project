## Key policy notes:

* Inflation: Sunak aims to halve inflation during the year 2023, in order to ease the cost of living and improve the financial security of the electorate.

* Debt: Sunak aims to make sure the national debt is falling in order to attempt to secure the future of public services.

* Growth: Sunak aims to grow the economy in order to create better-paid jobs and opportunity across all areas of the country.

* Climate Change: Sunak had originally committed to meeting the climate policy goals outlined by Theresa May's, and then Boris Johnson's governments, but the targets set out by these policies were altered in September 2023. Whilst the overall target of net zero by 2050 remains in place, other goals such as the ban on new petrol and diesel cars and vans has been delayed from 2030 to 2035. [see more]

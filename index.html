* Climate Change: Sunak has committed to the government's goal of reaching zero carbon emissions across the country's economy by 2050, but climate change was not listed in his 10-point plan.

	He has also been criticized for rolling back key green targets, such as delaying the ban on the sale of new petrol and diesel cars and pushing back net zero goals.


* Economy: Sunak has emphasized the need to bring down public debt and advocated for cutting taxes, but only if it's affordable.

	He has also backed the independence of the Bank of England and stressed the importance of government policy working alongside the central bank to tame inflation.

* National Health Service: Sunak has spoken about finding further efficiencies and savings in the system, but he has not tackled ways to reduce long hospital waiting lists or tackle the pay and conditions of health care workers who are threatening to go on strike.

* Conservative Party: Sunak's campaign launch statement said he wanted to "fix our economy, unite our party and deliver for our country".

	One of his first challenges will be to show he can control a Conservative Party that has a large majority in parliament but is riven with factions that differ on key issues like Brexit and immigration as well as economic management.

* Social Services: Starmer has pledged to abolish Universal Credit and end the Conservative Party's sanctions regime. He has also set a national goal for wellbeing to make health as important as GDP and to invest in services that help shift to a preventative approach. Additionally, he has promised to stand up for universal services and defend the National Health Service.

* Education: Starmer has supported the abolition of tuition fees and has promised to invest in lifelong learning.

* Missions: The Labour Party has outlined five bold missions for a better Britain, which include creating a million green jobs, providing free school meals for all primary school children, and ending rough sleeping within five years.
